## Project Overview

**App:** DairyPOS — A full Android ERP system for a dairy farming business.
**Purpose:** Manages complete daily business operations including procurement, production, inventory, sales, and accounting. Built by the business owner for their own dairy farm.
**Status:** Core ERP operations complete. Accounting automation in active development.
**Target:** Publishing within 2-3 months.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Platform:** Android (Kotlin)
- **Database:** SQLite via custom `DatabaseHelper.kt`
- **Architecture:** Repository pattern — each domain has its own repository class
- **Package root:** `com.example.dairypos`
- **Key packages:**
  - `com.example.dairypos.data.repository.erp` — all repository classes
  - `com.example.dairypos` — DatabaseHelper and core helpers

---

## Critical Code Conventions

### Extension Functions
All SQLite extension functions live in:
```
com/example/dairypos/data/repository/erp/SqliteExtensions.kt
```
Do NOT define extension functions inside `DatabaseHelper.kt` or any repository class. They must be top-level in `SqliteExtensions.kt` to be visible across all repositories.

Current extensions: `singleInt()`, `forEach()`
Add new extensions to `SqliteExtensions.kt` only.

### Repository Pattern
Each domain area has its own repository class in `data.repository.erp`.
- `ProcurementRepository.kt` — purchasing, AP entries
- Add new repositories following the same pattern
- Repositories receive `DatabaseHelper` via constructor injection

### DatabaseHelper
- `helper.writableDatabase` → use for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- `helper.readableDatabase` → use for SELECT queries only
- All SQL extension functions accept `Array<String>` for args, never `arrayOf()` with non-string types

## Accounting System Architecture

### How Journal Entries Work
```
Operational Event
    → accountingTransaction (log)
    → JournalEntryEngine.postJournalEntries()
    → looks up AccountingJournalsMap by transactionType + subType
    → inserts into journalEntries (Dr/Cr pairs)
```

### Key Tables
- `chartAccounts` — Chart of Accounts (COA)
- `standardAccountTypes` — Asset, Liability, Equity, Income, Expense
- `TransactionTypes` — named event types that drive journal automation
- `AccountingJournalsMap` — maps TransactionType+subType → debitAccountId/creditAccountId
- `accountingTransaction` — source log for every ERP event
- `journalEntries` — final double-entry ledger

### In-Progress: Accrual Automation
- `T_AP_ACCRUAL_HEADS` — static COA classifier for reporting (being implemented)
- `parentJournalId` — self-referencing FK on `journalEntries` for audit trail chaining (being implemented)
- EOM entries fired by a manual "Close Month" button (user-initiated)

### AccountingJournalsMap Sequence Logic
`sequence` orders multiple journal entries for a single transaction event. Entries are **evidence-based** — a sequence row only fires if the transaction payload justifies it. Accounting does not allow automatic chaining without evidence.

**Current state — Purchase (temporary simplification):**
```
sequence 1: Dr. Inventory (1001) / Cr. Payables (2000)  → records the liability
sequence 2: Dr. Payables  (2000) / Cr. Cash     (1000)  → settles immediately (cash assumed)
```
Sequence 2 on Purchase is a **temporary placeholder** — it assumes cash paid because the AP Payment module does not yet exist.

**Future state — once AP Payment module is built:**
```
Purchase event  → sequence 1 only (Dr. Inventory / Cr. Payables)
AP Payment event → own entry      (Dr. Payables  / Cr. Cash)
```
Sequence 2 will be removed from the Purchase mapping entirely and replaced by the `PayablePayment` transaction type firing its own evidence-based entry.

**General rules for sequence:**
- `condition = NULL` → always fires (unconditional)
- `condition = 'cashPaid=true'` → fires only if payload contains that flag (not yet implemented — reserved in `condition` column)
- Do NOT add new chained sequences without a corresponding payload condition — every entry must have evidence

---

## Known Issues (Fix Before Any Migration)

- `TransactionTypes` INSERT has a syntax error: `('ProductionExpense'),0` → remove the stray `0`
- COA codes `7000` and `7001` are both named "Vet Expense" — duplicate, needs resolution
- `PayablePayment` TransactionType is defined but not yet implemented — sequence 2 on Purchase is a temporary workaround until this module is built
- `Invoice` TransactionType is defined but not mapped in `AccountingJournalsMap`

---

## Developer Working Style & Preferences

- **Do not over-engineer** — keep solutions simple and direct. complexity is deferred deliberately.
- **No unsolicited refactoring** — only change what is asked. do not restructure code that isn't broken.
- **Discuss before implementing** — for architectural decisions, discuss in Q&A first, then implement.
- **Application layer first** — DB constraints and security rules are intentionally deferred to a later phase. do not add them unless asked.
- **Single responsibility** — one file per concern. don't combine unrelated logic.
- **Kotlin idioms** — use Kotlin-idiomatic code. prefer extension functions, `use {}` for cursor handling, named parameters where it aids clarity.
- **No new dependencies** — do not suggest adding new libraries unless explicitly asked.
- **SQL formatting** — use `trimIndent()` for multiline SQL strings in Kotlin. keep SQL readable.
- **Evidence-based entries** — journal entries must always be tied to a real transaction payload or user-initiated event. never assume or auto-chain without evidence.

## Session Startup Checklist

When starting a new session, Claude should:
1. Read this file
2. Ask the developer what they want to work on today
3. Do NOT make any code changes until the task is clearly understood

## Context Management

- When context reaches ~70% (`/context` to check) → remind developer to consider `/compact` or new session
- When starting a fresh session always re-read `CLAUDE.md` before touching any code

---

## Git Safety Protocol

Before any complex change, refactor, or multi-file edit, Claude must preserve the current working state via git stash:

```bash
# Step 1: Save all changes (tracked + untracked) as a named backup
git stash push -u -m "backup: <brief description of what is about to change>"

# Step 2: Immediately re-apply so the working directory is restored unchanged
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

**Why two steps:** `git stash push -u` cleans the working directory (including untracked files) as a side effect. The `apply` immediately restores everything, so work continues uninterrupted while the stash entry remains as a permanent backup.

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS run both steps together — stash then apply — so no files disappear from the working directory
- ALWAYS use `git stash apply` — **NEVER use `git stash pop`**
- `git stash apply` preserves the stash entry as a permanent backup copy in the stash list
- `git stash pop` destroys the stash entry after applying — no recovery if something goes wrong
- Use a descriptive stash message so backups are identifiable (`backup: before modularizing ProcurementRepository`)
- If `git stash apply` reports conflicts, stop and notify the developer before proceeding

**When to stash:**
- Before making changes to any code that is depended upon by components **outside the scope of the current task** — i.e. if touching shared code (extension functions, DatabaseHelper, base repositories, AccountingJournalsMap logic, JournalEntryEngine) that other unrelated modules consume, stash first
- If the change is fully self-contained within the component being worked on and no outside component depends on what is being modified, stash is not required
